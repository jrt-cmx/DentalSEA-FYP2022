# Project Requirement
This project aims to develop a web application for managing records of
customers of a dental centre. The application will be used by administrators to
manage historical records of those who use dental services provided by the
centre.

The web application needs to provide an UI for administrators to:
- Search for a patient profile based on their identity, e.g, Medicare card,
or date of birth, or name, etc.
- Add a new patient profile
- Edit/Delete an existing patient profile
- Produce a bill of each service used by the customer

A database system is required to manage dental health records of customers.
Each patient profile needs to include the following information:
- Personal information of the customer
- Historical health records like teeth issues 1, teeth issue 2
- His or her family members who are also customers of the centre
- Which service has been used by the user
- Which materials have been used for each treatment
- Which Medicare service has been claimed for each treatment
- Time records (e.g. expired date, checking period) of each material used
for treatment
- Information of doctors ad related dental assistants are responsible for
each treatment

This application will help the administrators to quickly search for existing
customers as well as provide essential information for doctors to prepare for
new treatments to customers or remind them to periodically have dental care.
In addition, the application enables administrators to produce a bill for each
service used by the customer and link the service to the customerâ€™s Medicare
ID.
